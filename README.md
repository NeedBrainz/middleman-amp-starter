# [Middleman AMP Starter](https://amp-demo.needbrainz.com/) âš¡

A starter site template to kickstart a middleman website with AMP pages.
Like [AMP Start](https://ampstart.com) the css part is built on top of [Basscss](http://basscss.com/) a low-level CSS toolkit and Gulp.


## Installation
Require NodeJS, npm (>=3), Ruby and RubyGems
To install simply execute
```
npm install
bundle install
```

### Local Running
Use middleman server command, Gulp will be running as an external pipeline for asset recompilation and live reload (use localhost:3000 instead of middleman port)
```
bundle exec middleman server
```

### Building
Use middleman normal build method ;)
```
bundle exec middleman build
```
